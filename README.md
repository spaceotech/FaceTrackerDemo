Android Face Detection Example Readme

With the release of Google play services 7.8, Google added Mobile Vision APIs. This API includes a new framework that allows camera to face track in the Android app. And there are also several benefits like auto exposure, auto facelock, etc which makes the user-experience more impressive.

Thus, we finally decided to create a demo on it and written a tutorial: [Introducing Face Track Feature With Android Face Detection Example](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-face-detection-example/)
